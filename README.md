*Smart Image Tagger

**Smart Image Tagger** is a web-based AI application that identifies everyday objects and analyzes environmental greenery directly in the browser — powered by **TensorFlow.js** and **JavaScript**.

This project demonstrates how pre-trained deep learning models can be integrated into web applications to make AI lightweight, fast, and sustainable.

##   Features
-  Upload any image — the app automatically detects and classifies objects.  
-   Uses **MobileNet (TensorFlow.js)** to recognize over **1,000 ImageNet categories**.  
-   Calculates vegetation coverage percentage using pixel-level color analysis.  
-   Emoji-enhanced, user-friendly interface built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
-   Runs completely in-browser — **no server or external API required**.

##   How It Works
1. Loads the **MobileNet** deep learning model from TensorFlow.js.  
2. When an image is uploaded, it’s processed into tensors and classified.  
3. Displays top predicted labels with confidence percentages.  
4. Performs pixel-wise analysis to calculate greenery coverage.  
5. Shows both AI predictions and greenery score in an intuitive UI.
